# Facial Landmark Detection 
### Machine Learning technique that detects different points on your face. Mesh is generated when points are combined together. The generated mesh like you can see in the video below. Here the model detects 486 3D facial landmarks to infer the approximate surface geometry of the human face.

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm install`

Then 

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Then the output is displayed on (localhost:3000) in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
